# Hardware ðŸ”©
I have gradually built up a lot of hardware overtime to from sensors to switches which allow automations to come to life. As part of this journey, I learnt a lot and amassed a lot of different devices with varying compatibilities. This is the beauty of [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) to use multiple eco systems together.

[Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) is running on a custom built computer running [Unraid](https://unraid.net/) as the base Operating System.

## <a name="controllers"></a>Hubs / Controllers
At the heart of everything are hubs / controllers. These are devices that bridge the different protocols to talk to computers. For example Zigbee to WiFi.

## Amazon
We are an Echo/Alexa household due to the compatibility it has with devices. This is less of an issue since moving to [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io).

## Ecowitt
Weather station for more local and accurate weather data. Unfortunately, it does not provide forecast data.
*   [Wittboy](https://shop.ecowitt.com/en-gb/products/wittboy?variant=41794776006818) The rain sensor fails to accurately read rain.

## Elgato
I love Elgato products. They are generally well designed however you do pay a price.

*   [HP M402DW](https://www.printerland.co.uk/product/hp-laserjet-pro-m402dw/138809)

## Ikea
Love the Ikea blinds. They are easy to get hold of compared to other products and once you get over the pairing, they have worked flawlessly.

## Lifx
The light output is one of the best in terms of lumens. The colours are generally very good. The downside has been pairing them to the WiFi on Android has been hit and miss. Once connected, there has been no issues.

## Logitech
Until Broadlink came along, Logitech was the only player in town to integrate remote control. The hub has been unstable however there were no alternatives at the time. I haven't integrated any automations as a result.

## <a name="philipshue"></a>Philips Hue
Well engineered and personally, asthetically pleasing compared to some of it's competitor. Whilst I have a Hue Hub, not all Hue devices are paired to the hue Hub e.g motion sensors are paired to the Samsung SmartThings hub.

## Ring
Does not have all the support with [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io), however [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) fills the gap. Not too many issues to report and works well in general. The 1st generation alarm works with 2nd generation sensors.

## <a name="smartthings"></a>Samsung SmartThings
Some real gems that Samsung has made like the multipurpose sensor where Philips doesn't have. Generally reliable and well packaged.

## Shelly
I like their hardware relays and fits into 35mm back boxes and allows switches to function normally.
*   [Plus 1PM](https://shelly.cloud/shelly-plus-1pm/)

## Sonoff
Relatively cheap hardware and some unique offering however lacks out of the box support.
*   [USB Smart Adaptor](https://sonoff.tech/product/diy-smart-switch/micro/)
*   [USB Smart Adaptor Zigbee](https://sonoff.tech/product/diy-smart-switches/zbmicro/)

## SwitchBot
The first curtain rod devices. It uses bluetooth which isn't great for range so I pair it with the hub mini
*   [SwitchBot Blind Tilt](https://uk.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-blind-tilt)
*   [Hub Mini](https://uk.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-hub-mini)

## TP Link
Bought one of these as a potential replacement to the Belkin Wemos which had the killer feature of time to switch off when it was powered on built into the app/plugs. The TP Link did not have that but it does have all the other features like power monitoring. This has been installed behind a hard to reach metal white goods where Zigbee was not strong enough to reach but WiFi was.

## TuYa
Very well priced IoT device manufacturer. I am using the temperature sensor for inside the fridge and freezers. The radiator values are closes to the Tado TRVs. It's not as well built but the idea is you don't need to touch it.
