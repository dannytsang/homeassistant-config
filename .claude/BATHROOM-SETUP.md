        ├─ Exhaust fan: OFF → ON
        ├─ Noise: Fan running
        └─ Logging humidity event
        ↓
Window still closed (cool day, don't want AC loss)
        ├─ Exhaust fan is primary ventilation
        └─ Optional: Reminder "Consider opening window"
        ↓
Fan runs continuously
        ↓

## 9. Status Indicators

### Light Status

- **Off** → Lights extinguished
- **On** → Full brightness active
- **Dimmed** → 50% warning (motion stopping)
- **Night Light** → 10% warm (low-visibility mode)

### Humidity Status

- **Normal** → <60% (dry, safe)
- **Elevated** → 60-75% (slightly damp)
- **High** → 75-85% (exhaust active)
- **Critical** → >85% (potential mold risk)

### Motion Status

- **Active** → Movement detected, lights stay on
- **Inactive** → No motion, timer started
- **Timeout** → Timer expired, lights off

### Ventilation Status

- **Off** → Humidity below threshold
- **Running** → Exhaust fan clearing moisture
- **Long Run** → Critical humidity or window-closed mode

---

## 10. Key Features & Automations Highlights

### Smart Motion-Based Lighting
- **Automatic On:** No switches to flip when entering
- **Graceful Off:** Timer prevents lights left on accidentally
- **Manual Override:** Switch always works independently
- **Daylight Aware:** Doesn't activate if already bright

### Humidity Management
- **Automatic Ventilation:** Fan runs when needed
- **Mold Prevention:** Keeps moisture under control
- **Window Coordination:** Respects open/closed status
- **Customizable Threshold:** Adjust for your climate

### Health Routine Tracking
- **Toothbrush Logging:** Automatic usage tracking
- **Reminders:** Alerts if brushing too short
- **Historical Data:** See patterns over time
- **Privacy-First:** Data stays local, not cloud-synced

### User-Friendly Design
- **Minimal Intervention:** Motion does most work
- **Manual Control:** Always respected (switch overrides)
- **Logical Defaults:** Warm light, 10-20 min timeout
- **Accessible:** Works for family members of all ages

---

## Implementation Notes

### Motion Sensor Setup

1. **Sensor Placement**
   - Mount on ceiling, angled toward main entry/mirror
   - Avoid mounting directly above heat source (shower)
   - Clear line-of-sight to bathroom area

2. **Sensitivity Calibration**
   - Adjust to detect person entering
   - Avoid false triggers from shower steam
   - Test with typical movements (standing, sitting)

3. **Detection Range**
   - Small bathroom: Usually 6-8 feet detection OK
   - Set timer for 5-10 minutes (adjust based on usage)

---

### Humidity Sensor Setup

1. **Calibration**
   - Baseline reading with door open (outdoor humidity%)
   - Test threshold during/after shower (peak humidity)
   - Typical bathroom peak: 75-85% (varies by ventilation)

2. **Threshold Selection**
   - Conservative: 70% (fan runs often, but safe)
   - Moderate: 75% (standard recommendation)
   - Aggressive: 80% (saves fan runtime)

3. **Placement**
   - Often integrated in motion sensor
   - Avoid direct water spray
   - Keep sensor dry

---

### Timer Configuration

1. **Timeout Duration**
   - 10 minutes: Quick auto-off (save energy)
   - 15-20 minutes: Standard (typical bathroom use)
   - 30 minutes: Extended (large family)

2. **Warning System**
   - Optional: Dim to 50% at 5-min mark (user warning)
   - Optional: Notification before cutoff
   - Manual switch always works (no timeout affects it)

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Lights Won't Turn On on Motion

**Symptoms:** Motion detected but lights stay off

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check motion sensor is powered/connected
2. Verify automation is enabled
3. Check light entity responds to manual commands
4. Check time/conditions (maybe disabled during day?)

**Solutions:**
- Power cycle motion sensor
- Test automation manually in UI
- Verify light is controlled by correct entity
- Check if daylight-only mode is active

---

### Lights Stay On Too Long

**Symptoms:** Lights stay on hours after leaving bathroom

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check motion sensor (may be detecting water movement)
2. Verify light-off timer is configured
3. Check timer automation is enabled

**Solutions:**
- Move motion sensor away from shower area
- Reduce timer duration (15 min → 10 min)
- Test manual light-off to verify it works
- Check for continuous motion triggers

---

### Exhaust Fan Won't Turn On

**Symptoms:** Humidity high but fan doesn't activate

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check humidity reading is actually high (sensor reading)
2. Verify exhaust fan switch exists and is controllable
3. Check humidity automation is enabled
4. Verify humidity threshold setting

**Solutions:**
- Calibrate humidity threshold (lower if needed)
- Test fan manual control in UI
- Verify exhaust fan switch entity is correct
- Check automation logs for errors
