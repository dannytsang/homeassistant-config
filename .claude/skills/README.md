**Version:** 1.0
**Created:** 2026-01-23
**Status:** Production

---

## Overview

This directory contains specialized Claude skills designed to optimize Home Assistant configuration management. Each skill is a reusable methodology documented for systematic application.

## Available Skills

### 1. **HA Motion Consolidator**
**File:** `ha-motion-consolidator.md`

Consolidates motion-based automations using trigger ID branching and choose blocks.

**Use When:**
- Multiple automations trigger on same motion sensor
- Different responses for motion on/off states
- Light control patterns (on/off/dim)
- Context-aware lighting (brightness, time-based, etc.)

**Typical Results:**
- 40-60% reduction in automation count
- 50%+ line count savings
- Improved maintainability

**Example:** Consolidated 6 stairs automations → 3 automations (-40%)

---

### 2. **HA YAML Quality Reviewer**
**File:** `ha-yaml-quality-reviewer.md`

Systematically reviews YAML packages for syntax errors and quality issues using severity-based prioritization.

**Use When:**
- After creating or modifying automations
- Regular quality audits
- Before major commits
- During code review phase

**Issue Categories:**
- 🔴 CRITICAL: Blocking errors (syntax, undefined refs, missing params)
- 🟡 MEDIUM: Functionality impacts (missing fields, formatting, spacing)
- 🟢 LOW: Cosmetic issues (consistency, grammar, emoji usage)

**Typical Results:**
- 20-30 issues identified per 11 packages
- 100% CRITICAL issues fixable
- Improved code consistency

**Example:** Reviewed 11 packages, found 26 issues (9 critical, 11 medium, 6 low)

---

### 3. **HA Consolidation Analyzer**
**File:** `ha-consolidation-analyzer.md`

Identifies consolidation opportunities by analyzing trigger/condition/action patterns and scoring them.

**Use When:**
- Starting optimization phase
- Auditing automation density
- Planning consolidation roadmap
- Evaluating new packages

**Scoring System:**
- 80-100: CRITICAL consolidation (Motion on/off pairs)
- 60-79: HIGH priority (Time-based variants)
- 40-59: MEDIUM priority (Context-aware variants)
- 0-39: LOW or skip

**Typical Results:**
- 50-70% consolidation opportunities identified
- Clear prioritization (what to consolidate first)
- Risk/complexity assessment

**Example:** Stairs package - 7 motion automations analyzed → 3 consolidation recommendations

---

### 4. **HA Reflection Reviewer**
**File:** `ha-reflection-reviewer.md`

Systematically reviews recent git commits to identify patterns in user corrections and learn from implementation errors.

**Use When:**
- After completing major implementation phases
- Weekly/monthly quality audits
- When user reports repeated error patterns
- Before starting similar implementation work
- Quarterly continuous improvement reviews

**Review Process:**
- Analyzes user fix commits vs Claude implementation commits
- Categorizes error types (syntax, entity reference, logic, quote)
- Documents root causes and prevention strategies
- Updates skills and reference docs with learnings
- Tracks metrics and improvement trends

**Typical Results:**
- 5-10 error patterns identified per review
- 100% of errors documented and prevented
- Skill updates with new validation rules
- Continuous improvement cycle established

**Example:** 2026-01-24 reflection found 5 critical error types, updated 3 skills with new validation rules

## Skill Workflow

### Standard Optimization Flow
```
1. ANALYZE (Consolidation Analyzer)
   └─ Identify opportunities, score, prioritize

2. CONSOLIDATE (Motion Consolidator)
   └─ Apply consolidation patterns, test

3. REVIEW (YAML Quality Reviewer)
   └─ Validate syntax, find issues, fix

4. COMMIT & TEST
   └─ Final validation before deployment

5. MONTHLY REFLECTION (Reflection Reviewer)
   └─ Review accumulated changes, learn from corrections, update skills
```

### Monthly Maintenance
**First of every month:** Run Reflection Reviewer to analyze all changes from previous month, identify patterns, and update validation rules based on learnings.

### Example: Phase 4 Session
```
Consolidation Analyzer:
  Input: Stairs package (7 motion automations)
  Output: 3 consolidation opportunities identified (85%+ scores)

Motion Consolidator:
  Input: Before-bedtime automations (ID 1598726353326, 1598726353327)
  Output: Single consolidated automation (OR condition pattern)

YAML Quality Reviewer:
  Input: All fixed packages
  Output: 26 issues identified (9 critical, 11 medium, 6 low)

Result: 6 automations → 3, 85 lines saved, 0 critical issues
```

---

## Phase Integration

### Phase 4: Consolidation
- **Analyzer:** Identify opportunities (Step 1)
- **Consolidator:** Apply patterns (Step 2)
- **Reviewer:** Validate (Step 3)
- **Result:** Fewer, more maintainable automations

### Phase 5: Quality Assurance
- **Reviewer:** Comprehensive package review
- **Consolidator:** Re-check for missed opportunities
- **Result:** High-quality, consistent codebase

### Phase 6+: Ongoing Maintenance
- **Analyzer:** Quarterly consolidation audits
- **Reviewer:** Before each major change
- **Consolidator:** Apply new consolidation opportunities

## Metrics & ROI

### Session 2026-01-23 Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Automations Consolidated | 15 |
| Consolidation Ratio | 50% (30 → 15) |
| Lines Saved | ~85 |
| Issues Found | 26 |
| Issues Fixed | 26 (100%) |
| Critical Issues | 0 (down from 9) |
| Review Time | 2-3 hours |
| ROI | ~3 lines saved per minute |

### Expected ROI for New Packages

- **Small room (5-10 automations):** 1-2 hour review + consolidation
- **Medium room (10-20 automations):** 2-3 hour review + consolidation
- **Large room (20+ automations):** 3-4 hour review + consolidation

---

## How to Use These Skills

### For New Automations
```
1. Create automation
2. Run YAML Quality Reviewer (catch issues early)
3. Consider Consolidation Analyzer (should this be merged?)
4. Commit & test
```

### For Package Reviews
```
1. Use Consolidation Analyzer (what can be consolidated?)
2. Use Motion Consolidator (apply patterns)
3. Use YAML Quality Reviewer (comprehensive validation)
4. Commit changes by severity (critical → medium → low)
```

### For Optimization Cycles
```
1. Consolidation Analyzer (identify all opportunities)
2. Prioritize by score (high-scoring first)
3. Motion Consolidator (apply pattern)
4. YAML Quality Reviewer (validate)
5. Repeat until score < 40%
```

## Key Patterns Documented

### Motion Automations
- **Trigger ID Branching:** On/off pair consolidation
- **OR Conditions:** Context-aware light states
- **Time-based Branches:** Before/after bedtime variants
- **Safety Fallbacks:** Motion off with light state checks

### Quality Checks
- **Emoji Codes:** `:ladder:` → 🪜 conversions
- **Required Fields:** title, log_level, message
- **Quote Consistency:** Unquoted vs quoted values
- **Entity References:** Undefined vs valid

### Consolidation Scoring
- **High Score (80-100):** Motion on/off pairs, magic mirror patterns
- **Medium Score (60-79):** Time-based variants, context-aware logic
- **Low Score (0-59):** Complex nested logic, safety-critical differences

### Motion Consolidator Quick Start
```yaml
# Pattern: Motion on/off → Single automation
triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id: sensor.motion
    to: "on"
    id: motion_on
  - trigger: state
    entity_id: sensor.motion
    to: "off"
    id: motion_off
# Then use: condition: trigger id: [motion_on | motion_off]
```

### YAML Quality Reviewer Quick Checks
```
Search for:
- :[a-z_]+: (invalid emojis)
- send_to_home_log without title:
- unquoted Debug/Normal
- Missing quotes on strings
```

### Consolidation Analyzer Quick Score
```
Score 80+: Motion on/off, Magic mirror → CONSOLIDATE
Score 60-79: Time variants, Context logic → CONSOLIDATE
Score 40-59: Complex nesting → CONSIDER
Score 0-39: Safety-critical → SKIP
```
