# Introduction üì¢
My ‚öΩgoal with home automation is to never have to think about doing something mentally or physically. This can be turning on a üí°light through to household chores such as üëïwashing clothes. Currently, my journey continues.

I have always been interested in technology starting from the x10 days. At the time, I was did not have the money or üß¨life experience to use the üíªtechnology at the time. Fast forward a few üìÖdecades, I'm fortunate enough to have the means and place to splurge on home automtion and [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) is the key to all of this.

This project contains configuration files for [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) used in the House of Tsang Êõæ)

More details to follow. Visit my üìú[blog](https://dannytsang.co.uk).

# Integrations üñß
There are too many to list and changes now and then so I will list the ones that will help explain configurations. These may include integrations from [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/).

### HACS
An amazing community store (almost) from interface to integrations not available natively in [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io). [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) plugs a hole where things are not officially supported can be easily installed. Because it's community supported, use with caution.

### Frigate NVR
[Frigate](https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate-hass-integration) performs real time image/video detection using Google's TensorFlow machine learning technology. The key difference is the real time where it will take a stream from a camera and process it in real time. When it detects something, it will alert Home Assistant and you can do what you want with that state change / event.

### GlowMarkt
The [Display and CAD](https://shop.glowmarkt.com/products/display-and-cad-combined-for-smart-meter-customers) replaced the in home display provided by my energy provider and has the added benefit of direct smart meter "real time" data via API and MQTT. It is more accurate than the [CurrentCost](#currentcost) because it reads directly from the meter. Also it should have gas usage but I am unable to get this to work at the moment.

### Unifi
[Ubiquiti Unifi](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/unifi/) allows for network based presence detection. The advantage is the integration will poll for devices from the controller which would be aware of the network where as the UPnP integration relies on network scans instead.

Other noteworthy mentions:
* [CO2 Signal](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/co2signal/)
* [HASS-Deepstack-face](https://github.com/robmarkcole/HASS-Deepstack-face)
* [HASS-Deepstack-object](https://github.com/robmarkcole/HASS-Deepstack-object)
* [IFTTT](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/ifttt/)
* [Network UPS Tool](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/nut/)
* [Slack](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/slack/)

# GitHub üê±üêô
This repository contains the configuration files used. It will not contain everything e.g. password (A.K.A secrets.yaml) file as well as other configuration done in the User Interface (UI).

Whilst [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) offer backup solution, it is a bit of all or nothing restore process where as Git (or any versioning system) would allow incremental changes to be stored and reverted where necessary.

## Setup ‚öôÔ∏è
I use the UI as much as possible to create and maintain changes. There's currently a general movement towards the UI within [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) such as setup of integrations being removed from the configuration files. I generally support this move to make it easier for everyone.

All changes are performed in the UI where possible and if they are held in configuration files then it will end up in Git where possible.

I use the Visual Studio Code add-on to edit files in [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) or if I really have to the File Editor add-on on my mobile deives.

Visual Studio Code addon includes a Git client so all changes are managed through the text editor.

## Workflows üñáÔ∏è
The advantage of using a source code management system like Git is the ability to use hooks to trigger actions (as well as other advantages).

I use GitHub actions to verify the changes committed by running it against [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) builds. If successful, [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) will pull down the changes and if the changes are configuration related (as opposed to readme / markdown files) then it will perform another local configuration check and restart to pick up the changes.

For this reason, the `custom_components` is stored in the repository to allow a successful build and configuration check.

## Structure üß±
This repository's top level is the /config folder where typically the configuration.yaml file resides. More details can be found [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/).

I use some of the "advance" configuration options such as [split configuration](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/splitting_configuration/) and [packages](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/packages/).

### Blueprints
I have yet to explore this feature yet. See [here](https://github.com/dannytsang/homeassistant-config/issues/9).

### Camera
Private directory to hold camera images. Predominantly used for sending images to [DeepStack](https://deepstack.cc/).

### ESPHome
Files related to managing the ESP microcontroller. See [ESPHome.io](https://esphome.io/) for more details.

### Packages
See [packages readme](packages/README.md) for more details.

### Split Configurations
I use split configuration files to help manage and keep the `configuration.yaml` size down. The advantange is each type of configuration such as scripts, scenes, etc will be managed by [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) UI with minimal setup.

### www
A public folder for holding any files such as images that does not need authentication. I use it for attaching images to notifications.

## Tags / Releases üè∑Ô∏è
I will apply a tag before upgrading to a major/minor/monthly release of [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io). These will represent a snapshot of a (hopefully) stable configuration used prior to upgrading and a point to restore back to if needed.

# Miscellaneous
I tried the [Conbee II](https://phoscon.de/en/conbee2) USB stick and it was good however it was tied to a computer running Deconz which makes it harder to put in the house in a central location compared to the a hub like [Philips Hue](#controllers) or [SmartThings](#controllers).
