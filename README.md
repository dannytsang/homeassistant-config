# Introduction üì¢
My ‚öΩgoal with home automation is to never have to think about doing something mentally or physically. This can be turning on a üí°light through to household chores such as üëïwashing clothes. Currently, my journey continues.

I have always been interested in technology starting from the x10 days. At the time, I was did not have the money or üß¨life experience to use the üíªtechnology at the time. Fast forward a few üìÖdecades, I'm fortunate enough to have the means and place to splurge on home automtion and [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) is the key to all of this.

This project contains configuration files for [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) used in the House of Tsang Êõæ.

More details to follow. Visit my üìú[blog](https://dannytsang.co.uk).

## Hardware
I have gradually built up a lot of hardware overtime to from sensors to switches which allow automations to come to life. As part of this journey, I learnt a lot and amassed a lot of different devices with varying compatibilities. This is the beauty of [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) which allows me to cross eco system compatibility.

[Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) is running on a Dell OptiPlex 3060 SFF running [Unraid](https://unraid.net/) as the base Operating System.

### Hubs / Controllers
At the heart of everything are hubs / controllers. These are devices that bridge the different protocols to talk to computers. For example Zigbee to WiFi.
* [Philips Hue Hub v2](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-bridge/046677458478)
* [Samsung SmartThings v3](https://www.samsung.com/uk/smartthings/hub-f-hub-uk-v3/)
* <strike>[Conbee II](https://phoscon.de/en/conbee2)</strike> - Currently having stability issues where the USB device is disconnected/not detected.

### Amazon
We are an Echo/Alexa household due to the compatibility it has with devices. This is less of an issue since moving to [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io).
* [Echo 1st Gen](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Bluetooth-Speaker-with-WiFi-Alexa-White/dp/B00X4WHP5E?th=1)
* [Echo dot 2nd Gen](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Amazon-Echo-Dot-2nd-Gen/dp/B01DFKBL68)
* [Echo dot 3rd Gen](https://www.amazon.co.uk/All-new-Echo-Dot-3rd-Gen/dp/B07PFFMV56/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=echo+dot+white&qid=1629415420&sr=8-2)
* [Echo show 10 2nd Gen](https://www.amazon.co.uk/All-New-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/dp/B0793G9T6T?th=1)
* [Echo show 5 1st Gen](https://www.amazon.co.uk/amazon-echo-show-5-compact-smart-display-with-alexa/dp/B07KD7TJD6?th=1)

### Aqara
I have just started to look at this manufacturer since I got the Conbee II stick.
* <strike>[Temperature and Humidity Sensor](https://www.aqara.com/en/temperature_humidity_sensor.html)</strike> - See Conbee II above.

### CurrentCost
A long standing device I had before [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io), it uses a clamp and battery to read electricity usage from the meter. Later, they came out with plugs that sense power draw as well. All of this is using [Energy@Home](https://github.com/dannytsang/energyathome) to store readings and present it in [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io).
* [Data Cable](http://www.currentcost.com/product-datacable.html)
* [Envi](http://www.currentcost.com/product-cc128.html)
* [Individual Application Monitors](http://www.currentcost.com/product-iams.html)

### Elgato
I love Elgato products. They are generally well designed however you do pay a price.
* [Key Light](https://www.elgato.com/en/key-light)
* [Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/en/stream-deck)

### GLEDOPTO
Third party WLED to Zigbee controller.
* RGB CCT 1D

### Google
Really like the casting feature to share content however found it was relatiely unstable and would loose connectivity or stop playing.
* [Chromecast](https://store.google.com/gb/product/chromecast?hl=en-GB)
* [Chromecast Ultra](https://store.google.com/nz/product/chromecast_ultra?hl=en-GB)

### Hive Home
Probably the first smart house item we purchased in 2010. There are a lot better options now and it works but has reliablility issues and would look to replace at some point.
* Hive 1 (SLT2)

### Ikea
Love the Ikea blinds. They are easy to get hold of compared to other products and once you get over the pairing, they have worked flawlessly.
* [FYRTUR](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/fyrtur-block-out-roller-blind-wireless-battery-operated-grey-60408181/)
* [KADRILJ](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/kadrilj-roller-blind-wireless-battery-operated-grey-30408154/)
* [TR√ÖDFRI GU10](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/tradfri-led-bulb-gu10-400-lumen-wireless-dimmable-white-spectrum-90408603/)
* [TR√ÖDFRI Remote control](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/tradfri-remote-control-30443124/)

### Lifx
The light output is one of the best in terms of lumens. The colours are generally very good. The downside has been pairing them to the WiFi on Android has been hit and miss. Once connected, there has been no issues.
* [Candle White to Warm](https://uk.lifx.com/collections/lamps-and-pendants/products/candle-white-to-warm)
* [Color A19](https://www.lifx.com/products/lifx-color-a19)
* Color 1000
* [Mini White](https://eu.lifx.com/products/lifx-mini-white)

### Logitech
Until Broadlink came along, Logitech was the only player in town to integrate remote control. The hub has been unstable however there were no alternatives at the time. I haven't integrated any automations as a result.
* [Harmony Elite](https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/products/harmony/harmony-elite.915-000257.html?crid=60)

### Philips Hue
Well engineered and personally, asthetically pleasing compared to some of it's competitor. Whilst I have a Hue Hub, not all Hue devices are paired to the hue Hub e.g motion sensors are paired to the Samsung SmartThings hub.
* Dimmer switch
* [Motion sensor](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-gb/p/hue-motion-sensor/8718696743171)
* [Outdoor (motion) sensor](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-gb/p/hue-outdoor-sensor/8718699625474)
* [Play light bar](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-gb/p/hue-white-and-colour-ambiance-play-light-bar-double-pack/7820230P7)
* [White and colour ambiance (E14)](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-gb/p/hue-white-and-colour-ambiance-single-bulb-e14/8718696695166)
* [White and colour ambiance (E27)](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-gb/p/hue-white-and-colour-ambiance-1-pack-e27/8718699673109#overview)

### Raspberry Pi Foundation
A powerful and relatively cheap SOC board to power home projects. I have these monitoring UPS through to in home display.
* [Raspberry Pi 4 model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/)

### Ring
Does not have all the support with [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io), however [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) fills the gap. Not too many issues to report and works well in general.
* [Doorbell 2](https://en-uk.ring.com/products/video-doorbell-2)
* [Security 1st Gen](https://www.amazon.co.uk/ring-alarm-5-piece-kit-home-security-system-with-optional-assisted-monitoring-no-long-term-commitments-works-with-alexa/dp/B087Q3BR8M0)
* [Stickup Cam Elite](https://en-uk.ring.com/products/stick-up-security-camera-elite)

### Roku
Relatively cheap and usable media streaming device (compared to a PlayStation). Has a wide variety of support for apps and more reliable than Chromecast devices.
* [NowTV Smart Stick](https://www.nowtv.com/ie/smart-tv-stick)
* [Streaming stick+](https://www.roku.com/en-gb/products/streaming-stick-plus)

### Samsung SmartThings
Some real gems that Samsung has made like the multipurpose sensor where Philips doesn't have. Generally reliable and well packaged.
* [Multipurpose Sensor](https://www.samsung.com/uk/smartthings/sensor/smartthings-multipurpose-sensor-gp-u999sjvlaea/)
* [Smart Plug 2019](https://www.samsung.com/uk/smartthings/outlet/smartthings-smart-plug-gp-wou019bbdwg/)
* [Water Leak Sensors v3](https://www.samsung.com/uk/smartthings/sensors-plug-f-wtr-uk-v3/)

### Sonoff
Relatively cheap hardware and some unique offering however lacks out of the box support.
* [USB Smart Adaptor](https://sonoff.tech/product/diy-smart-switch/micro/)

### Ubiquiti
Fully kitted networking gear of choice and provides really good integration with [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io).
* [Unifi AC Lite](https://www.ui.com/unifi/unifi-ap-ac-lite/)
* [Unifi Security Gateway](https://www.ui.com/unifi-routing/usg/)
* Unifi Swtich 8
* [Unifi Switch 24](https://store.ui.com/collections/unifi-network-switching/products/usw-24)

### Wemos
Small WiFi development board with an ESP8266 chip. I'm using [Tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io) firmware but looking to switch to [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) at some point.
* [D1 mini pro](https://www.wemos.cc/en/latest/d1/d1_mini_pro.html)
