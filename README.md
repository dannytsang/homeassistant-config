## Hardware
I have gradually built up a lot of hardware overtime to from sensors to switches which allow automations to come to life. As part of this journey, I learnt a lot and amassed a lot of different devices with varying compatibilities. This is the beauty of [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) which allows me to cross eco system compatibility.

### Hubs / Controllers
At the heart of everything are hubs / controllers. These are devices that bridge the different protocols to talk to computers. For example Zigbee to WiFi.
 * Philips Hue Hub v2
 * Samsung SmartThings v3
