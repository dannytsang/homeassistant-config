Configuration files for [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) used in the House of Tsangs.

More details to follow. Visit my [blog](https://dannytsang.co.uk) in the mean time.

## Hardware
I have gradually built up a lot of hardware overtime to from sensors to switches which allow automations to come to life. As part of this journey, I learnt a lot and amassed a lot of different devices with varying compatibilities. This is the beauty of [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) which allows me to cross eco system compatibility.

### Hubs / Controllers
At the heart of everything are hubs / controllers. These are devices that bridge the different protocols to talk to computers. For example Zigbee to WiFi.
 * [Philips Hue Hub v2](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-bridge/046677458478)
 * [Samsung SmartThings v3](https://www.samsung.com/uk/smartthings/hub-f-hub-uk-v3/)
 * [Conbee II](https://phoscon.de/en/conbee2)

### Philips Hue
Well engineered and personally, asthetically pleasing compared to some of it's competitor. Whilst I have a Hue Hub, not all Hue devices are paired to the hue Hub e.g motion sensors are paired to the Samsung SmartThings hub.
