# Energy âš¡
All electrical related integrations from solar to EV charging.

## EcoFlow
Battery system that provides a convenient EPS system and some energy monitoring capabilities.

## MyEnergi
[Eddi](https://github.com/CJNE/ha-myenergi) for the solar diverter and EV charger.

## Solcast
Used for solar forecasting. The data it provides is better than forecast.io but unfortunately there is no homelab friendly subscription.

## Solar Assistant
Replaces the Growatt integration that does not work. It has a faster refresh on data as well.
