# Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning ðŸŒ¬
Integrations related HVAC. There were enough stuff to separate these out into their own sub folder.

## Hive (Home)
Controls the central heating and hot water via a gas boiler. It also has thermostat to measure the room temperature.

## MyEnergi
[Eddi](https://github.com/CJNE/ha-myenergi) is connected to the immersion heater in the hot water tank and can be controlled independently to the boiler. The main use is to soak up the additional solar electricity rather than exporting it. However, using Octopus Agile 0 or negative rates has allowed automated heating of the water and get paid for it without having to stay up at night or remembering to set a schedule in the app.

Zappi EV charger from MyEnergi also uses this integration.
